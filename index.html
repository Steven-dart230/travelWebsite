The water in Puerto Rico is something everyone looks forward to and it feels amazing! Puerto Rico is surrounded by crystal-clear waters that attract beach lovers, snorkelers, and surfers from around the world.

        <li id="hiking">One of the most common activities in Puerto Rico is to zip line through the Rainforest in San Juan!! This is one of the best activites there is to do while traveling to Puerto Rico. One of the most thrilling ways to explore Puerto Rico’s lush landscapes is by zip lining through El Yunque National Forest, the only tropical rainforest in the U.S. National Forest System. Soaring through the treetops gives you a bird’s-eye view of the dense greenery, waterfalls, and mountain terrain. Zip lining here is not just about the adrenaline; it’s also a unique chance to experience the rainforest's beauty from above while learning about its biodiversity.

    <li class="styleRule1">In Puerto Rico you can find hiking nearly everywhere you go. Because Puerto Rico is an Island, it is common to see groups of people hiking around uncharted locations! What you'll see varies from location to location but regardless, it is all worth it! For those who love to hike, Puerto Rico offers trails for all skill levels. El Yunque features some of the island’s most popular hiking routes, leading to breathtaking waterfalls, scenic lookouts, and hidden pools. The trails wind through thick jungle and cloud-covered peaks, making each hike an adventure. Other great spots include Toro Negro Forest and Guánica Dry Forest, offering different ecosystems and views. Hiking in Puerto Rico is a rewarding way to connect with nature and discover parts of the island that are off the beaten path.

         <ul>
             <li>In Puerto Rico, food is something that is greatly cherished. At least for me! Food around the world is unique. I might be bias but Puerto Rico has the best food all around!! To me, there is no competition. Puerto Rican cuisine is a flavorful blend of Spanish, African, and Taíno influences. Local dishes like mofongo—mashed plantains with garlic and pork cracklings that are rich, savory, and full of character. Arroz con gandules (rice with pigeon peas) and lechón (roast pork) are staples at family gatherings and festivals. Street food, such as alcapurrias and empanadillas, offers quick bites packed with flavor. Fresh tropical fruits and locally grown coffee also highlight the island’s vibrant culinary scene.
